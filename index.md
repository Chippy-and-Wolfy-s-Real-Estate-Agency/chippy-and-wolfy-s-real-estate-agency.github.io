## Listings:

We have currently two listings **The Tree** and **The Cave**.


>##### The Tree
Hello buyers! Me, Chippy Brown and Wolfy Gray are here with a new habitat up for sale, The Tree is a perfect place to hangout with you fellow friends. The tree is a   tree house built for chipmunks and squirrels, also free from any preadators! 


>##### The Cave
Hello House Hunters, I am Wolfy Gray, and I am here with my partner, Chippy Brown. We are right now at our old home which is now being renovated and prepared for       selling. My buddy Chippy shall talk about the tree house on top, while I talk about my part of the house, the cave.

The cave entrance is on the first floor of this humble home and honestly, it looks spectacular. It seems small from the outside but inside there are… Two bathrooms,   three bedrooms, one master bedroom, a kitchen, a fireplace, a downstairs, an indoor pool, a game room (games for wolves like a automatic tennis ball server for fetch), a dining room, a living room, two storage closets, a storage room, a study, and a library. It is a house that I can’t believe I am leaving this place, but I must move on. The master bedroom is a one and a half story room in the back of the first floor and it has a window looking over the beautiful lake, it has a king size bed and   small work space found on the small platform held up above the bed  by steel supports surrounded by wood. There is a small five step staircase leading up to it.
The library is my favorite room and is filled with relics and other artifacts from my adventures before settling down and opening many businesses with Chippy.

And the last special feature is (drum roll please) The special electronique security system and the houses ai, A.C.O.R.N.N. (Artificial Computer Organized Robotic     Neuro Network). It is an artificial intelligence system that controls every camera or electronic device in the house and is capable of bringing up G.L.A.D.O.S. (Giant Lethal Armed Defensive Offensive System. The system in charge of protecting the outside.) These two defence systems are linked to my phone, are not programmable, they have a mind of their own and if told to do something evil or against the law.


Now, you might be wondering, how do I manage to do all this, that you will not know until the finale of this house selling show. Goodbye and I will see you next time.
